This void absorbs and nullifies all incoming attacks, making the user essentially invincible within its boundaries. The technique is activated by the user creating a spherical barrier around themselves, which then expands outward to encompass the desired area. The void created by Gojo's Infinity is said to be impenetrable and can only be deactivated by the user themselves. This technique is one of the most powerful abilities in the Jujutsu Kaisen series and is a testament to Gojo's immense skill and power as a sorcerer.\n",

      "\n",
      "In some stories, cursed energy can be harnessed or manipulated by individuals with certain abilities or powers.
